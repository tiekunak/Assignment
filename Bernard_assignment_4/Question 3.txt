1. obtain a number from the user.
2. set an option to find out if the number obtained is equal to 0
3. if the number is equal to 0, print "the result is 0.
4. But if the number is not equal to 0, 
5. Obtain the second number fromt he user
6. compute number 1 * number 2 into variable results
7. Print" the results"




Pseudo code

Start
	print " Enter a number"
	Define the variable number 1
	
	if number 1 = 0, 
		print" the result is zero"
	else, 
		print "enter the second number"
		Define the variable second number
		Define variable results = number 1 * number 2
		print" the result is = results
End
