1. obtain a first number from the user.
2. Obtain a second number fromt he user
3. set an option to find out if the second number obtained is equal to 0
4. if the second number is equal to 0, print "infinity".
5. But if the second number is not equal to 0, 
6. compute number 1 / number 2 into variable results
7. Print" the results"



Pseudo code

Start
	print " Enter a number"
	Define the variable number 1

	print "enter the second number"
	Define the variable second number 2
	
	
	if number 1 = 0, 
		print" the result is zero"
	else, 
		Define variable results = number 1 * number 2
		print" the result is = results"
End
